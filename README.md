## Overview

As part of my internship at **BNS Cyberlab**, I conducted a **Digital Investigation** focused on examining, analyzing, and interpreting digital evidence related to potential security incidents.

The main objective was to:

* Systematically collect and preserve digital artifacts
* Analyze system and network data
* Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Support incident response and forensic reporting

This exercise provided **hands-on exposure** to real-world digital forensics, including **evidence handling, investigative tools, and structured workflows** used in professional cyber incident investigations.

### **Step 1 – Evidence Collection & Preservation**

* Acquired relevant digital evidence from computers, storage devices, and network sources using approved forensic methods.
* Ensured integrity of evidence via verified forensic images and **chain of custody** documentation.

### **Step 2 – Data Extraction & Processing**

* Extracted files, system logs, registry entries, and network activity records.
* Converted raw data into a structured and searchable format for detailed forensic analysis.

### **Step 3 – Forensic Analysis**

* **File & Metadata Analysis:** Reviewed file attributes, timestamps, and metadata to reconstruct timelines.
* **Log & Network Analysis:** Investigated logs for suspicious connections, unauthorized access, or anomalies.
* **Malware & Artifact Examination:** Identified and analyzed malicious files, scripts, or artifacts linked to the incident.

### **Step 4 – Reporting & Intelligence Correlation**

* Documented findings in a detailed forensic report, including evidence sources, analysis methods, and conclusions.
* Correlated results with known threat intelligence to identify attack patterns or threat actors.

## Tools Used

* **Wireshark** – Captured and analyzed network traffic, inspected email packet exchanges, and verified secure protocols.
* **HxD Hex Editor** – Opened and analyzed binary files, generated test files, and inspected file headers.
* **Base64 Utility (Python & CLI)** – Decoded Base64 strings and decrypted encrypted email content.

## Benefits of Digital Investigation

* **Rapid Detection** – Accelerates phishing and malware identification
* **Accuracy** – Reduces false positives through automated checks
* **Scalability** – Handles high data volumes efficiently
* **Intelligence-Driven** – Integrates with live threat feeds for up-to-date detection

---

## Conclusion

This internship project allowed me to apply **digital forensics and cybersecurity skills** to a real-world scenario.
Through the integration of **Wireshark**, **HxD**, and **Base64 decoding**, I gained experience in:

* Handling raw data
* Decoding encrypted content
* Monitoring network activity related to email processing

The project successfully met its goal of building a **cybersecurity automation workflow** for threat detection and reinforced the value of structured, tool-assisted analysis in defending against evolving cyber threats.
